## LOGS


### **Day 1: JavaScript Drum Kit**

**Learnings:** 
-  `transition`: It allows to change property value smoothly, over a given duration.[`transition: width 2s;`]
-  `transform` : It allows to -
    - move : moves element from curretn position. [`translate(50px, 60px)`]
    - rotate : rotates element clockwise or counter-clockwise according to given degree. [`rotate(20deg)`]
    - scale: increase/decrease size of element with given times of width and height. [`scale(2,3)`]
    - skew: skews an element along the X and Y-axis by the given angles. [`skew(20deg, 10deg)`]
- `transitionend` event: This event fired when CSS transition has completed.

**Tool Found:** Find JavaScript event keycodes at [keycode.info](http://keycode.info/)
